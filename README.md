## Official ModHub 

I'm actively working to get this mod published on ModHub.  

**Important Note:** The ModHub version will reset to 1.0.0.0 upon release, so don't worry if you see this version number thereâ€”itâ€™s intentional.  

I'm doing everything I can to meet ModHubâ€™s requirements. Theyâ€™ve provided feedback with some issues, and Iâ€™m diligently testing and fixing them to ensure the mod meets their standards.  

Please be patient as I work through this process. Additionally, I wonâ€™t release another official update until the mod is live on ModHub.  

Thank you for your understanding and support!
